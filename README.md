# Quadratic Equations Solver

A program **quadratic_equation.py** contains a function **get_roots(a, b, c)** that solves a quadratic equation  
``a x^2 + b x + c = 0`` in real numbers. 
A file tests.py is for testing purposes and can be run as:

```#!bash 
$ python tests.py
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
